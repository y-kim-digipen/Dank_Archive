After making sure that all the files and settings are OK, hit Build.

Make sure you include the required dll files (for the SFML audio) in the executable's directory.

“How To Play” Instructions

This game's goal is simple, try not shoot the enemy first before they come to you. 

Utilize the two different perspectives provided as much as possible in order to deal with those enemies efficiently.

Trying to hear as much as you can will help notice where they are coming and who are they.
